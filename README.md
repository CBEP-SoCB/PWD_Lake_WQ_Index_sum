# Portland Water Quality Lake Index
This short repository includes data that underpins the Portland Water District 
(PWD) Lake Index, and code for redrawing their excellent summary graphics in
R. The primary purpose of the repository is to redraw those graphics so that
they look more similar to other graphics in the SoCB report.
